# AverageSpeed
Calculate and store average speed for journeys.

I travel quite a bit and enjoy having a speedometer app that gives me the average speed for that journey. But other than screenshotting the end screen there was no way to keep track of the different journeys I did an their average speeds.

So I wrote this application which will do that for me.

By getting latitude/longitude and time every 20 seconds, the app will calculate the path then distance of the trip.
Using the duration it will then calculate the average speed of the journey.  
I also ended up adding in a distance travelled and a speedometer for interest sakes.
